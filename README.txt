The dataset has been imported from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/, the first one enlisted in the paragraph: "recommended for education and development".
From which a zip has been downloaded, in which there were 4 files: `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. Only 2 of them will be taken into consideration for the analysis: movies.csv and ratings.csv, which will undergo further analysis and data wrangling.

Furthermore, the data wrangling will eventually create the dataset that will be addressed in MongoDB, as well as in the further analysis in Python, which is "merged_movies_ratings". 

Eventually, all queries and extra work will refer only to the data included in the "merged_movies_ratings" file, that is created from the 2 files imported from the link mentioned before, plus the execution of the operations enlisted in the python file dataWrangling.ipynb. 

Moreover, all the work done as data visualisation (extra), has been developed in the extra.ipynb file, as it is documented in the pdf.
